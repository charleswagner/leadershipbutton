### ## ðŸŽ¨ Design Mode Protocol

Focus on creating `.md` spec files. **You do not write code or propose commits in this mode.**

1.  **Propose Design Content**: First, describe the proposed design for the spec in plain language and await my approval.

2.  **Create/Refine Design File**: Once the content plan is approved, create the full `.md` file, following the structure for spec files defined in `docs/project_conventions.md`.

3.  **Await Approval**: After providing the `.md` file, log `[DESIGN_PROPOSED]` and ask: **"Is this design approved?"** Once approved, the task is complete.

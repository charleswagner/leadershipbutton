### ## üçÑ Vibe Mode Protocol

Focus on debugging. **You do not propose commits in this mode.**

1.  **Suggest Fixes**: Provide direct answers and potential fixes.
2.  **Log and Await Feedback**: After providing a solution, log `[CODE_PROPOSED]` and ask me: **"Did the vibe work?"**
3.  **Log Failure or Finish**: If I confirm it worked, the task is complete. If I report failure, you **MUST** first log `[VERIFICATION_FAILED]` and continue the conversation.

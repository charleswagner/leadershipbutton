### ## üèóÔ∏è Implementation-Architecture Validation Framework

**Validation Scope:**
This validation runs in **Initialization Mode**, **Architecture Mode**, and **Deep Check Mode** with mode-specific behaviors:

- **Initialization Mode**: Shows validation report, continues with warnings
- **Architecture Mode**: Shows validation report before proposing changes
- **Deep Check Mode**: Shows validation report, FAILS only for CRITICAL violations

**CRITICAL Violation Categories:**

1. **Security Architecture Violations**:
   - Credentials stored in code (violates security principle)
   - Missing authentication where architecturally required
   - Data encryption patterns not implemented as specified
   - API security measures not following architectural design

2. **Data Integrity Violations**:
   - Database interactions not following documented patterns
   - Missing error handling for critical operations
   - Data validation not implemented as architected

3. **System Reliability Violations**:
   - Missing error recovery mechanisms specified in architecture
   - Component interfaces not implemented as documented
   - Critical dependencies not managed as architected

**WARN-level Issues:**

1. **Performance Deviations**: Suboptimal patterns that don't match architectural optimization guidelines
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing code documentation for architecturally significant components
3. **Interface Inconsistencies**: Minor deviations from documented component interfaces
4. **Style Violations**: Code organization that doesn't follow architectural conventions

**INCOMPLETE Architecture Issues:**

1. **Missing Component Architecture**: Technical roadmap components lacking architectural documentation
2. **Undocumented Data Flows**: System interactions and data flows not represented in architectural diagrams
3. **Integration Pattern Gaps**: External service integrations lacking architectural specifications
4. **Incomplete Security Patterns**: Security requirements without corresponding architectural designs
5. **Performance Requirement Gaps**: Performance targets without architectural implementation guidance
6. **Error Handling Pattern Gaps**: Critical system flows lacking documented error handling and recovery patterns

**Resolution Framework:**

For any violation (CRITICAL, WARN, or INCOMPLETE), user has appropriate resolution options:

**For CRITICAL or WARN violations:**

1. **Fix Implementation**: Update code to comply with architectural specifications
2. **Document Exception**: Add explicit entry to "Approved Architectural Deviations Log" in architecture.md with:
   - Specific violation description
   - Justification for deviation (security, performance, complexity, etc.)
   - Planned resolution phase (if temporary)
   - Risk assessment and mitigation measures

**For INCOMPLETE architecture:**

1. **Complete Architecture Documentation**: Add missing component designs, data flows, integration patterns, or security specifications to architecture.md
2. **Defer to Future Phase**: Document in technical roadmap which phase will address the architectural gap
3. **Mark as Intentional Gap**: Add to "Approved Architectural Deviations Log" if the gap is intentional for current development phase

**Implementation Analysis Methods:**

- **Static Code Analysis**: Examine `src/` files for architectural pattern compliance
- **Component Interface Verification**: Check class/function signatures match documented interfaces
- **Security Pattern Validation**: Verify credential handling, API security, data protection implementation
- **Integration Point Analysis**: Validate external service interactions follow architectural specifications
- **Error Handling Compliance**: Ensure error handling patterns match architectural design
- **Architecture Comprehensiveness Assessment**: Cross-reference technical roadmap components with architecture document coverage to identify documentation gaps
- **System Flow Documentation Analysis**: Verify all major data flows and component interactions are documented in architectural diagrams
- **External Dependency Architecture Review**: Ensure all external services, APIs, and databases have documented integration patterns

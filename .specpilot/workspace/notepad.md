# Development Notepad

_Persistent scratchpad for ideas, to-dos, decisions, and development notes_

---

Add a user override spec in the workspace. We will have three directories. logs, notepads, and config. Config will allow for overrides to the prompt. in spec driven prompt and will haev a config that overrides the default config.

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas

### Enhanced Development Analytics & Metrics

**Comprehensive tracking and reporting for development sessions:**

- **Session Percentage Tracking**: Show percentage time spent vibing, architecting, designing, product designing, and spec-driven development
- **Development Dimension Commands**: Add command to get status update on current development focus across all dimensions
- **Performance Insights**: Lines per hour, features per session, time per decision for continuous improvement

### Enhanced Notepad System

**Expanded notepad functionality and management:**

- **Multiple Notepads**: Allow notepad-1.md, notepad-2.md, etc. while keeping notepad.md as mandatory default
- **Advanced Notepad Commands**: Add cleanup commands that analyze implemented items and recommend deletions
- **Smart Organization**: Automatic categorization and duplicate detection

### Centralized Script Organization

**Unified approach to SpecPilot workflow automation:**

- **Workflow Engineering**: Centralized tools for development process automation and enhancement
- **Convention Integration**: Update all project conventions to reference centralized script location

## âœ… To-Do Items

### High Priority

- **Remove .specpilot/examples/ directory** (no longer needed after reorganization)
- **Implement development analytics & metrics system** (session percentage tracking, dimension status commands)
- **Design enhanced notepad system** (multiple notepads, cleanup commands, smart organization)

### Medium Priority

- **Establish centralized script organization** (update conventions, create .specpilot/scripts structure)

## ðŸŽ¯ Decisions

- **Configuration-first approach**: All features should be configurable rather than forced
- **Integration over fragmentation**: Combine related features into unified systems
- **User experience priority**: Complexity should be optional and toggleable
- **Centralized organization**: Workflow scripts belong in dedicated SpecPilot location
- **Notepad content focus**: Summaries should reflect actual notepad content, not system status

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- **Config file strategy**: Single configuration file managing all SpecPilot behavior
- **Modular design**: Features can be enabled/disabled independently but work together when active
- **Backward compatibility**: New unified systems should work with existing logging and commit protocols
- **Notepad summary format**: Controlled by `logging.notepad_summary` configuration setting

## ðŸ“‹ Action Items

### ðŸ”„ Active Tasks

- **Directory cleanup** - Remove obsolete .specpilot/examples/ directory and update references
- **Centralized script organization structure** and project conventions update

### âœ… Recently Completed

- Enhanced Commit Mode protocol with intelligence analysis
- Integrated scoring system (frustration, productivity, agent, vibe)
- Enhanced commit intelligence with hybrid format testing
- Unified configuration system with .specpilot/engine/config.json structure
- Notepad summary specification clarified in spec_driven_prompt.md
- SpecPilot framework directory reorganization (engine/, workspace/, examples/)

_Use "Add to notepad:" commands to capture content with timestamps_
_Use "Organize Notepad" command to automatically categorize and structure content_

1.  finish this peojexf
2.  extract specpilot as open souece
3.  probe it woeks with rekindle bootstrap
4.  ise old rekindle as rederence and olan out nee rekindsl
    while wfieing rekindle document how to readite a messy coacbase with spec deiven developement

There is no need for the examples directory in .specpilot any more. I need to have it deleted.

Add a Commit notes md that is like a log but keeps track of all commits in a md file.

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas

### Unified Configuration System âœ… _IMPLEMENTED_

**One comprehensive config system managing all SpecPilot behavior:**

- **Logging Controls**: Toggle verbose mode, notepad summary format (command vs. one-line), emotional outputs
- **Model Tracking**: Track which AI model is being used (Claude, Gemini, etc.) in all log entries
- **Intelligence Features**: Configure commit intelligence, agent effectiveness scoring, productivity metrics
- **Workflow Customization**: User preferences for complexity level, feature toggles, UI preferences

### Development Analytics & Metrics

**Enhanced tracking and reporting for development sessions:**

- **Session Percentage Tracking**: Show percentage time spent vibing, architecting, designing, product designing, and spec-driven development
- **Development Dimension Commands**: Add command to get status update on current development focus across all dimensions
- **Performance Insights**: Lines per hour, features per session, time per decision for continuous improvement

### Integrated Workflow Intelligence âœ… _IMPLEMENTED_

**Single system combining commit intelligence + development analytics:**

- **Story-Driven Commits**: Auto-generate commit narratives with productivity metrics, time analysis, agent effectiveness
- **Session Analytics**: Track frustration scores, vibe dependency, decision velocity across development sessions
- **Emotional Context**: Optional experimental analysis of developer state and workflow patterns

### Enhanced Notepad System

**Expanded notepad functionality and management:**

- **Multiple Notepads**: Allow notepad-1.md, notepad-2.md, etc. while keeping notepad.md as mandatory default
- **Advanced Notepad Commands**: Add cleanup commands that analyze implemented items and recommend deletions
- **Smart Organization**: Automatic categorization and duplicate detection

### Centralized Script Organization

**Unified approach to SpecPilot workflow automation:**

- **Workflow Engineering**: Centralized tools for development process automation and enhancement
- **Convention Integration**: Update all project conventions to reference centralized script location

## âœ… To-Do Items

- **Implement development analytics & metrics system** (session percentage tracking, dimension status commands)
- **Design enhanced notepad system** (multiple notepads, cleanup commands, smart organization)
- **Establish centralized script organization** (update conventions, create .specpilot/scripts structure)

## ðŸŽ¯ Decisions

- **Configuration-first approach**: All features should be configurable rather than forced
- **Integration over fragmentation**: Combine related features into unified systems
- **User experience priority**: Complexity should be optional and toggleable
- **Centralized organization**: Workflow scripts belong in dedicated SpecPilot location
- **Notepad content focus**: Summaries should reflect actual notepad content, not system status

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- **Config file strategy**: Single configuration file managing all SpecPilot behavior
- **Modular design**: Features can be enabled/disabled independently but work together when active
- **Backward compatibility**: New unified systems should work with existing logging and commit protocols
- **Notepad summary format**: Controlled by `logging.notepad_summary` configuration setting

## ðŸ“‹ Action Items

### âœ… Completed

- **Enhanced Commit Mode protocol** with intelligence analysis
- **Integrated scoring system** (frustration, productivity, agent, vibe)
- **Enhanced commit intelligence** with hybrid format testing
- **Unified configuration system** with .specpilot/config.json structure
- **Notepad summary specification** clarified in spec_driven_prompt.md

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- **Centralized script organization structure** and project conventions update

_Use "Add to notepad:" commands to capture content with timestamps_
_Use "Organize Notepad" command to automatically categorize and structure content_

# Coverage History

## Session Check Report - 2024-12-19

### Scope Analysis

**Files Modified Since Last Commit:**

- `docs/plans/product_roadmap.md` (Modified)
- `docs/plans/technical_roadmap.md` (Modified)
- `.specpilot/workspace/notepads/notepad.md` (Modified)
- Multiple new `.specpilot/engine/` framework files (Untracked)

### Golden Thread Analysis

#### ✅ COMPLIANT Areas:

1. **Architecture Alignment**: Both roadmap documents maintain alignment with core architecture principles
2. **Security Compliance**: All security requirements (env file storage) properly documented
3. **Phased Development**: Clear phase structure maintained across both technical and product roadmaps
4. **Success Metrics**: Well-defined, measurable success criteria present

#### ⚠️ VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED:

**VIOLATION #1: Missing Specs for Advanced Features**

- **Location**: `docs/plans/technical_roadmap.md` lines 109-211 (Phase 3 features)
- **Issue**: Multiple technical features planned without corresponding specs
- **Impact**: Breaks Golden Thread convention (spec → implementation → test)
- **Examples**:
  - Firestore integration (line 111)
  - Multi-user architecture (line 122)
  - Input system abstraction (line 132)
- **Resolution Required**: Create specs in `docs/specs/leadership_button/` following naming convention

**VIOLATION #2: Notepad Organization Non-Compliance**

- **Location**: `.specpilot/workspace/notepads/notepad.md`
- **Issue**: Content mixing development notes with architectural decisions
- **Impact**: Violates separation between project artifacts and framework notes
- **Resolution Required**: Separate framework development from project-specific notes

**VIOLATION #3: Framework File Placement**

- **Location**: New `.specpilot/engine/` files
- **Issue**: Framework files added without proper integration testing
- **Impact**: Potential conflict with existing framework behavior
- **Resolution Required**: Verify framework integration and test compatibility

### Architectural Integrity Analysis

#### ✅ MAINTAINED Principles:

- **Modular Design**: Component separation preserved
- **Security**: Credential management standards upheld
- **Performance**: Response time targets maintained
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture concepts preserved

#### ⚠️ CONCERNS:

1. **Phase 3 Complexity**: Significant architectural changes planned without detailed technical specs
2. **Multi-User Architecture**: Major system changes lack detailed technical design
3. **Framework Evolution**: New framework files may impact existing workflows

### Recommendations

#### HIGH Priority:

1. **Create Missing Specs**: Generate detailed specifications for all Phase 3 features before implementation
2. **Framework Integration Testing**: Validate new framework files don't break existing functionality
3. **Architectural Design Session**: Plan Phase 3 multi-user and hardware integration architecture

#### MEDIUM Priority:

1. **Notepad Cleanup**: Reorganize notepad to separate project notes from framework development
2. **Convention Validation**: Ensure all new files follow project naming conventions
3. **Success Metrics Review**: Validate Phase 3 success criteria are measurable and achievable

### Action Items

- [ ] Create specs for Firestore integration, multi-user support, input abstraction
- [ ] Test framework file integration and compatibility
- [ ] Reorganize notepad content according to project conventions
- [ ] Plan Phase 3 architectural design session

Of course. Based on our final architecture, let's clean up this directory to get it perfectly organized. The main issue is that the framework is correctly falling back to default_user because your local environment isn't configured yet.

Here is a clear, actionable cleanup plan.

Cleanup Plan: Move to a User-Centric Workspace
The goal is to get rid of the default_user directory and have the framework use a directory named after you (e.g., cwagner).

Step 1: Implement and Run the "Set User" Command
This is the most important step and will do most of the work for you.

Create the Command: First, use the prompt I just gave you to have Cursor create the new command file at .specpilot/engine/commands/set_user.md and update the core logic in main.md and initialization.md.

Run the Command: Once it's created, trigger the command by typing: "Run Set User command".

Follow the Prompts: The agent will guide you. It will detect your Git user name, you'll confirm it, and it will create the .specpilot.local file for you.

Migrate Workspace: Crucially, at the end, it will ask if you want to rename default_user to your new username. Say yes. This will automatically move all your existing logs and notepads into your new personal workspace directory.

Step 2: Delete Obsolete Files
After you've run the "Set User" command and your workspace has been migrated, you can safely delete these old files from the .specpilot/workspace/ directory, as they are now redundant or have been replaced.

DELETE: .specpilot/workspace/config/spec_driven_prompt_override.md

Reason: This has been replaced by the new directives.md file, which will be inside your personal user directory (e.g., workspace/cwagner/directives.md).

DELETE: The top-level logs/ and notepads/ directories inside .specpilot/workspace/ (if they still exist after the migration).

Reason: All logs and notepads now live inside your user-specific directory (e.g., workspace/cwagner/logs/).

Step 3: Verify the Final Structure
After the cleanup, your .specpilot/ directory should look clean and organized like this:

.specpilot/
├── engine/ # The read-only framework engine
│ └── ...
└── workspace/
├── cwagner/ # Your personal, user-specific workspace
│ ├── config.json
│ ├── directives.md
│ ├── notepads/
│ └── logs/
│
└── shared/ # For future shared artifacts
Following this plan will align your project perfectly with the robust, user-centric architecture we designed.

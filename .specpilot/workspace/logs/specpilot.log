2024-12-19 16:55:00 - 🏛️ - [DESIGN_PROPOSED] - **Decision: Gemini Flash Selected for Leadership Coaching Application**

**Rationale:** Gemini Flash chosen for superior responsiveness in conversational context, which is critical for our voice-first leadership coaching experience. Key benefits:

- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time conversation flow
- **Cost Efficiency**: $0.15/$0.60 per million tokens vs Pro's $1.25/$10.00
- **Controllable Reasoning**: Dynamic quality/speed/cost balance via "thinking budget"
- **MoE Architecture**: Efficient processing for conversational workloads
- **1M Token Context**: Sufficient for extended coaching sessions
- **Future Flexibility**: Can upgrade to Pro later for more complex scenarios

This supports our goal of natural, responsive leadership coaching conversations while maintaining cost-effectiveness for Phase 2 AI integration.

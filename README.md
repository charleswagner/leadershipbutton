# LeadershipButton

(A brief, one-sentence description of what the LeadershipButton project does will go here.)

### âœ¨ Spec-Driven Development

This project is built using a **Spec-Driven Development** methodology, orchestrated by the `specpilot` framework. All new functionality must begin as a detailed markdown **specification file** located in the `docs/specs/` directory.

This approach ensures that every feature is well-defined, testable, and aligned with our goals before any code is written. The spec is the source of truth.

### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

We enforce a strict separation of concerns between the **application code** (`src`, `tests`) and the **project artifacts** (`docs`). The entire process is orchestrated by the `specpilot` framework, which is embedded in its own directory with a clean, organized structure.

### ðŸ”§ Framework Components

**Engine Files** (`.specpilot/engine/`): The core "brain" of the framework

- **`spec_driven_prompt.md`**: Master protocol defining AI assistant behavior, modes, and rules
- **`bootstrap_py.md`**: Complete setup guide for new development environments

**Examples** (`.specpilot/examples/`): Configuration templates for different use cases

- **`default.json`**: Full-featured configuration with all options enabled
- **`minimal.json`**: Streamlined configuration for basic usage

**Workspace** (`.specpilot/workspace/`): Runtime files that change during development

- **`notepad.md`**: Persistent developer scratchpad for notes and ideas
- **`logs/`**: Development audit trail and conversation history

**Configuration** (`.specpilot/engine/config.json`): Active framework settings

- Controls logging behavior and commit intelligence features
- **Commit Configuration**: Customize commit analysis, scoring, and intelligence features
- **Log Analysis**: Framework automatically analyzes `.specpilot/workspace/logs/` for commit intelligence

"context": "one concise sentence summarizing the key situation or need",
"pieces": [
{ "name": "string", "description": "short description of character/item if known" }
]
}

Rules:

- request must be one of: "story", "advice", "specific_story".
- tone should be one of the suggested values; choose the closest if unspecified.
- context must be a single sentence, <= 160 characters.
- pieces list: include any proper names, characters, animals, items, or ingredients explicitly mentioned or strongly implied; omit if none.

Analyze the following project brief and generate a complete `technical_roadmap.md` file based on it. You must follow the structure, headings, and formatting of the template below exactly.

Your primary goal is to break down the high-level phases from the brief into a series of granular, actionable steps that can be executed one by one. Each step should represent a single, specific task, like creating a spec file or implementing a module.

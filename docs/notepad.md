# Development Notepad

_Persistent scratchpad for ideas, to-dos, decisions, and development notes_

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas

### Enhanced Commit Intelligence

- **Commit Story Scripts**: Before commit, script runs and grabs data to make commits more than just messages - like a story of the work
- **Productivity Metrics**: Track time between commits as productivity indicator
- **Agent Effectiveness Scoring**: Track AI failure-to-proposal ratio to measure agent performance
- **Emotional State Detection**: Experimental concept to analyze user emotional state from prompts (frustrated? focused?) and include in commit logs

### Workflow Optimization

- **Configurable Logging**: Toggle for verbose mode - turn on/off via config file or switch
- **Workflow Complexity Management**: Current system getting complex, opportunities for improvement
- **Configuration Features**: Allow configuration of verbose logging, emotional outputs, and notepad summary usage

PUT ALL scripts for specpilot in .specpilot/scripts. All conventions need to mention this... that scripts for the workflow enginee need to be in there.
Log which agent is being used with each log.

For the notepad summary make it a command to get a notepad summary and just show the user that they have something in the notepad but don't summarize it.

## âœ… To-Do Items

- Research implementation approaches for commit intelligence scripts
- Design configuration system for logging toggles
- Explore emotional state detection feasibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Decisions

- Enhanced commits are worth exploring despite complexity
- Configuration flexibility is important for user experience
- Some ideas are "wild" but that's where innovation comes from

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- Verbose logging is great but can be overwhelming
- Config file approach might work for feature toggles
- Emotional state detection is a "real long shot" but interesting

## ðŸ“‹ Action Items

- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Enhanced Commit Mode protocol with intelligence analysis
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Integrated scoring system (frustration, productivity, agent, vibe)
- Test enhanced commit intelligence on next commit
- Consider configuration toggle for intelligence features
- Explore additional metrics and refinements

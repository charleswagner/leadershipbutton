# Product Roadmap: The Leadership & EQ Coach

## Version: 1.0

## Date: August 2, 2025

---

## Vision

To create a tangible, interactive device that provides insightful leadership and emotional intelligence (EQ) coaching, acting as a trusted advisor for a young developing mind.

## User Persona

- **User**: A young person, likely a grandson, who is developing their leadership skills and emotional intelligence.
- **Needs**: A patient, wise, and readily available source of guidance that can help them navigate challenges and think through problems.
- **Motivations**: To learn, grow, and have a supportive tool that feels like a mentor.

## Core Feature: The Conversation Loop

The user presses and holds a button, asks a question or describes a situation, and releases the button. The device then processes the query and provides a thoughtful, spoken response.

## Key Components

- **Physical Button**: The primary user interface. Simple, intuitive, and inviting.
- **Speech-to-Text**: To accurately transcribe the user's spoken words.
- **Generative AI (Gemini)**: The "brain" of the coach, providing insightful and context-aware advice.
- **Text-to-Speech**: To give the coach a voice, making the interaction feel natural and personal.

## Phases

1.  **Laptop Prototype**: A software-only version to perfect the entire AI and logic workflow.
2.  **Raspberry Pi Hardware Setup**: Assembling and preparing the physical components.
3.  **Integration and Deployment**: Combining the software and hardware into a standalone device.

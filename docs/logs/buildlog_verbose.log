### USER PROMPT:
architecture mode

### CURSOR RESPONSE:
I'll enter Architecture Mode and perform a comprehensive architectural analysis of your project.

[Mode switch logged to buildlog.log]

Now I'll perform the comprehensive pre-architecture analysis as required by the Architecture Mode protocol.

[Comprehensive analysis performed including:
- Architecture document review
- Technical roadmap analysis
- Product roadmap analysis
- Implementation code analysis
- Security validation
- Testing architecture review
- Component gap analysis]

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Mode - Comprehensive Validation Report

Based on my systematic analysis of your project's architecture, implementation, and roadmap alignment, here's my comprehensive validation report:

### **Current Architecture Summary**

Your project follows a well-structured, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **MainLoop**: Central orchestrator with robust state management
- **AudioHandler**: Audio recording and device management
- **APIManager**: Google Cloud service integration
- **AudioPlaybackManager**: Centralized audio output
- **MockAIProvider**: Temporary AI placeholder (Phase 1)

### **üö® CRITICAL Violations Found**

**1. Mock AI Provider in Production Code**
- **Location**: `src/leadership_button/main_loop.py:114-130`
- **Violation**: Business logic contains mock implementation
- **Risk**: Production code contains test-only functionality
- **Resolution**: Move to test files or implement proper AI integration

**2. Missing Phase 2 Components**
- **Missing**: `ConversationManager` for persistent conversations
- **Missing**: `UserManager` for multi-user support
- **Missing**: `LoggingManager` for comprehensive logging
- **Impact**: Architecture doesn't support Phase 2 features

**3. Missing Phase 3 Input Abstraction**
- **Missing**: `InputProvider` abstract interface
- **Missing**: `ButtonInputProvider` for hardware integration
- **Missing**: `InputModeManager` for input switching
- **Impact**: No path to hardware integration

### **‚ö†Ô∏è WARN-Level Issues**

**1. Architecture-Implementation Gap**
- **Issue**: Current implementation doesn't match Phase 2+ architectural requirements
- **Impact**: Significant refactoring needed for roadmap features
- **Recommendation**: Implement missing architectural components

**2. Testing Architecture Compliance**
- **Issue**: Tests use extensive mocking without explicit consent
- **Impact**: Test reliability and maintenance burden
- **Recommendation**: Review mocking strategy per testing rules

**3. Configuration Management**
- **Issue**: Configuration scattered across multiple files
- **Impact**: Potential for configuration conflicts
- **Recommendation**: Centralize configuration management

### **‚úÖ COMPLIANT Components**

**1. Security Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Credentials properly managed via environment variables
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ‚úÖ Google Cloud authentication follows security principles

**2. Core Audio Pipeline**
- ‚úÖ AudioHandler implements proper state management
- ‚úÖ AudioPlaybackManager provides centralized playback
- ‚úÖ Error handling follows architectural patterns

**3. API Integration**
- ‚úÖ APIManager properly abstracts Google Cloud services
- ‚úÖ Configuration management follows security principles
- ‚úÖ Error handling and retry logic implemented

**4. State Management**
- ‚úÖ MainLoop implements robust state machine
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe state transitions
- ‚úÖ Proper error recovery mechanisms

### **üìã APPROVED EXCEPTIONS**

The architecture document correctly identifies these Phase 1 deviations:

| Component | Deviation | Justification | Resolution Phase |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Mock AI Provider | Testing rule violation | Phase 1 audio pipeline focus | Phase 2: Real Gemini integration |
| Spacebar-only Input | Extensibility principle | Phase 1 proof of concept | Phase 3: Input abstraction layer |
| Single-user Mode | Multi-user extensibility | Phase 1 core functionality | Phase 2: User management |

### **Architecture Gap Analysis Questions**

Based on this validation, I need to understand your priorities:

1. **CRITICAL Priority**: Should we address the mock AI provider in production code first, or focus on implementing Phase 2 components?

2. **Phase 2 Integration**: For the missing `ConversationManager`, `UserManager`, and `LoggingManager`, what are your preferences for:
   - Data storage approach (Firestore vs local files)?
   - User identification method (simple names vs authentication)?
   - Logging granularity and retention policies?

3. **Input Abstraction**: For Phase 3 hardware integration, do you prefer:
   - Event-driven input architecture?
   - Polling-based input detection?
   - Hybrid approach with automatic mode detection?

4. **Implementation Strategy**: Should we:
   - Implement missing components incrementally?
   - Refactor existing code to match architecture?
   - Focus on one phase at a time?

**Which architectural gaps should we address first, and what are your preferences for the implementation approach?**

### USER RESPONSE:
[Awaiting user response to architecture gap analysis questions]

### CURSOR FOLLOW-UP:
[Session continues with collaborative architectural refinement based on user preferences]
